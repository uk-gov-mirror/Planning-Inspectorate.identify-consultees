# Identify consultees

This is the monorepo for the Identify consultees service. This is a GIS tool for identifying consultees and managing the associated data.

## Getting started

* install Node 22+ (see `.nvmrc` if present, otherwise latest LTS)
* install Docker
* `npm i`
* `npm start` — creates local `.env` files if missing, starts SQL Server, runs migrations, and launches the manage app at http://localhost:8090

For Entra auth locally, set `AUTH_DISABLED=false` in `apps/manage/.env` and fill in the `AUTH_*` values from a teammate.

## WebStorm Run Configurations

Run configurations are included for most of the npm scripts. Node and npm must be configured for the project for them to work.
Go to Settings > Languages and Frameworks > Node.js and set the Node interpreter and package manager.
